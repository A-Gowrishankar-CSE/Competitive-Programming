## Problem Statement

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Your task is to determine whether **any two of them sum up exactly to the third one**.

If such a condition is satisfied, print `"YES"`.
Otherwise, print `"NO"`.

## Input Format

* The first line contains an integer `t` — the number of test cases
* Each test case contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`

## Output Format

For each test case:

* Print `"YES"` if any two numbers add up to the third
* Print `"NO"` otherwise

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`
* `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100`

## Examples

### Example 1

Input

```
3
1 2 3
3 4 5
1 1 1
```

Explanation

```
1 + 2 = 3   → YES
3 + 4 ≠ 5   → NO
1 + 1 ≠ 1   → NO
```

Output

```
YES
NO
NO
```

---

### Example 2

Input

```
2
0 0 0
2 2 4
```

Explanation

```
0 + 0 = 0 → YES
2 + 2 = 4 → YES
```

Output

```
YES
YES
```

## Approach

**Direct pairwise sum comparison**

## Intuition

There are only **three possible combinations** to check:

* `a + b == c`
* `a + c == b`
* `b + c == a`

If **any one** of these conditions is true, the answer is `"YES"`.

Because the input size is very small, a direct comparison is the simplest and clearest approach.

## Algorithm Steps

* Read the number of test cases `t`
* For each test case:

  * Read integers `a`, `b`, and `c`
  * Check all three pairwise sum conditions
  * Print `"YES"` if any condition is satisfied
  * Otherwise, print `"NO"`

## Visual Walkthrough

### Case 1

Input

```
a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
```

Check

```
a + b = 5 → matches c
```

Result

```
YES
```

---

### Case 2

Input

```
a = 1, b = 4, c = 10
```

Check

```
1 + 4 ≠ 10
1 + 10 ≠ 4
4 + 10 ≠ 1
```

Result

```
NO
```

---

### Case 3

Input

```
a = 0, b = 0, c = 0
```

Check

```
0 + 0 = 0
```

Result

```
YES
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

**O(1)** per test case
Only a constant number of comparisons are performed.

### Space Complexity

**O(1)**
No extra data structures are used.

## Solution Explanation

The solution evaluates all possible ways two numbers can form the third.

Since there are only three numbers, checking all combinations explicitly ensures correctness without introducing unnecessary complexity.

The use of logical OR (`||`) makes the condition compact and readable.

## Full Solution

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {

        int a, b, c;
        cin >> a >> b >> c;

        if (a + b == c || a + c == b || b + c == a)
            cout << "YES\n";
        else
            cout << "NO\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases Analysis

| a | b | c | Output |
| - | - | - | ------ |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | YES    |
| 3 | 3 | 6 | YES    |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | NO     |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | YES    |
| 5 | 2 | 1 | NO     |

## Edge Cases to Consider

* All values are zero
* Two values are zero
* All values are equal
* No possible sum matches

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Checking only one combination instead of all three
* Assuming sorted order is required
* Overcomplicating with loops or arrays

## Interview Relevance

* Tests logical reasoning
* Evaluates conditional checks
* Common warm-up problem in interviews and contests

## What This Problem Teaches

* Exhaustive checking over small input sizes
* Writing clear conditional logic
* Avoiding unnecessary abstractions

## Key Takeaways

* Small constraints often allow direct solutions
* Explicit checks improve clarity
* Simplicity leads to fewer bugs
